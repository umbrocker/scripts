# scripts
My useful bash and python scripts for CTFs<br>
Every script has its own description inside them.

# installation
```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/umbrocker/scripts
cd scripts
chmod +x installer
./installer
```

# updating scripts
```bash
cd /opt/scripts
git pull
# if you see new scripts, than run installer again
```

# TODO:
- add uninstall script
